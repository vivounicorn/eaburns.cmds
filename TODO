fmt.Print<whatever> should be changed to Stdout.Write()
or Stderr.WriteString() in a lot of places.  These functions
are guaranteed to return an error on a short write and
so they are more useful than I initially suspected.  Same
goes for bufio!

rm
rmdir
cp
mv
watch
realpath?
nm
test (-x may be hard since group stuff isn't really supported)
mc
tar
gzip
bzip
dc
bc
diff
sh (gosh?)
